REDUX PLAN
----------

This is the overview of the reducers:

rootReducer: {
	projectList: {},
	addedProject: {},
	selectedProject: {
		selectedProjectInfo: {},
		slideList: {},
		addedSlide: {},
		selectedSlide: {},
		updatedSlide: {},
		deletedSlide: {}
	},
	updatedProject: {},
	deletedProject: {}	
}

----------

Next, the actions, the reducers related to these actions, and the reducers' states' 
are described in the form:

(reducer):
	(request_action)
	(receive_action)
	(error_action)

	(state): {
    		isFetching: (true/false),
    		receivedAt: (time when received),
    		error: (possible error described),
		... ,
		...
	}

In addition to these, there is the rootReducer, which combines all of the reducers, and
the selectedProject, which combines all the reducers related to the selected project
